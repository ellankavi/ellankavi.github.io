#.	Repeat the tutorial problem using **solid** elements (meshed with the same number of elements).
#.	Do you observe a change in the resulting displacements and stresses?
#.	How many shell elements do you need to have converged displacement and stress results?
#.	How many solid elements do you need to have converged displacement and stress results?
