Final project
*************

The final project is an interesting one that involves sawing the human femur with a rotating saw blade.

You will be provided with:

*	the geometry, 
*	completed material model for femur and saw, and
*	the input file for LS-DYNA with most of the simulation parameters filled-in. 

Problem Statement
-----------------

A blade saw rotating at a speed of 18000 RPM (revolutions per minute) cuts the femur. It translates 50mm in 100ms in the negative Y-axis to cut through the femur.
The femur is made up of *plastic-kinematic* material that breaks after a particular internal element [yield] stress limit is reached. The saw is considered to be a rigid body that does not undergo any deformation. It is considered to be made up of stainless steel material.

In this project, most of the work is already done for you. You will only have to apply the boundary conditions:

*	femur head and epicondyles constrained in all degrees of freedom (the *blue* regions in the image).
*	saw *rotates* at 18000 RPM (revolutions per minute). NOTE that you will have to convert RPM to *radians-per-millisecond*.
*	saw translates at a speed of 0.5mm/ms.
*	the total duration of the simulation is 100ms (endT parameter).

You should see something like this:

Solution file
-------------

You may copy the solution file to test the example

.. code-block:: bash

	cp -r ~/kurs-ss2015/solutions/final_project ~/solutions

The folder 'final_project' containing this example has now been copied to the 'solutions' folder in your home directory. You may now try out the example or tweak it for the assignment.
