Finite Element Workshop
=======================

Contents:

This Finite Element (FE) Workshop will focus on the following:

*	Types of meshes - solid and surface meshes
*	Importance of meshing
*	Viewing (post-processing) the results

Software used:

*	LS-DYNA
*	LS-PrePost
*	Python

We will use a simple cube and a cantilever to illustrate the significance of meshing in a finite element analysis.

The cube-example will be worked out here and the students will have to apply the same 
techniques to model the behaviour of a cantilever. 

Towards the end, you'll be provided with an *almost* complete input file that you'll have to fill-in with small details
in order to be able to run it in LS-DYNA. This will be the final project.
